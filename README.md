Disease Detector
📌 Overview

The Disease Detector is a machine learning project aimed at predicting diseases based on patient health data. By applying classification algorithms, the model analyzes symptoms and medical attributes to provide predictions that may support healthcare diagnostics.

This project is built in Python using Jupyter Notebook and makes use of popular machine learning libraries for model training, evaluation, and visualization.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing and cleaning of health-related datasets

Training classification models for disease prediction

Evaluating performance using accuracy and other metrics

Saving/exporting trained models for reuse

Interactive and easy-to-follow implementation through Jupyter Notebook

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy, Pandas → Data handling and preprocessing

Scikit-learn → Machine learning algorithms

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Disease_Detector.git
cd Disease_Detector


Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows


Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage

Open the Disease_Detector.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data, train models, and generate predictions.

Optionally, use the saved .pkl model files for deployment in other applications.
